# NarnieCruiseLines
Description:
Narnia Cruise Lines has several ships and a variety of cruise itineraries, each involving several ports-of-call. The company wants to maintain information on the sailors and other people who currently work on each of its ships. It also wants to keep track of both its past and future cruises and of the passengers who sailed on the former and are booked on the latter. Each ship has many sailors on it including a captain, engineers, doctors and cooks. Clearly, a cruise involves exactly one ship and over time a ship sails on many cruises. Each cruise stops at one or usually several ports-of-call, each of which is normally host to many cruises, over time.  In addition, the company wants to maintain information about ports that it has not as yet used in its cruises but may use in the future. 
A cruise typically has many passengers on it and on average a ticket costs $900. Hoping for return business, the company wants to keep track of passengers that may have sailed on several of its cruises (and/or may be booked for a future cruise.) For a person to be of interest to the company, he or she must have sailed on or be booked on at least one of the companyâ€™s cruises. The company wants to keep track of how much money each passenger paid for each of their cruises, as well as their satisfaction rating of the cruise, if it has been completed.
Output:
Design a complete object-oriented system for cruise management based on the above specification. Your system must in the least provide the following features through a console based menu system: 
1. Create a cruise with ship, sailors and ports randomly. 
2. Add passengers to a cruise. Both manual and random options must be given. 
3. Provide reports on the following areas:  
  a. Revenue generated from the cruise passengers by nationality and age 
  b. Details of all Sailors that worked on a cruise and the total cost of paying their salaries and the total cost of docking at different ports 
  c. List of passengers with their details sorted by moneySpentOnCruise 
  d. Cruise evaluation by passengers (assume each passenger completes a 5 question survey at the end of the cruise and generate/store random responses) 
  e. Did the ship make a profit?  Use the expenses and earnings from passengers. 
4. Information about the cruise including employees, passengers, ports-of-call, and money spent by employees on the cruise must be stored in text files once the cruise is over.
